To cross-reference the SFW image thread with your own faves, just run the program with `python3 fave_stats.py`. To use your username instead of user id, run it with `python3 fave_stats.py --username`

Note: running it might work differently on windows or mac, no idea how you run a python script on those platforms, but it shouldn't be too different.
